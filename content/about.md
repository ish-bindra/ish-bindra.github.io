Hey there 👋, I am Ishmeet, a software engineer focused on DevOps, infrastructure, and building reliable systems at scale.

I write about things I’ve learned while working on real production systems — Docker, CI/CD pipelines, microservices, and the patterns that make distributed systems actually work.

If you’d like to get in touch, reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishbindra/), [GitHub](https://github.com/ish-bindra), or [ishmeebindra@outlook.com](mailto:ishmeebindra@outlook.com).
